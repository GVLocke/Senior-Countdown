# Senior-Countdown

Simple website that counts down to my senior graduation. As I only know basic web design code, it's mostly a conglomeration of other people's stuff, specifically various Pens from [Matt Smith](https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pens/public) and [Traf](https://codepen.io/traf).<br>
Progress bar animation uses the [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) engine.
