# Senior-Countdown
https://gvlocke.github.io/Senior-Countdown/

Simple website that counts down to my college graduation (The date is speculation at this point). As I only know basic web design code, it's mostly a conglomeration of other people's stuff, specifically various Pens from [Matt Smith](https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pens/public) and [Traf](https://codepen.io/traf).<br>
Progress bar animation uses the [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) engine.

## Roadmap
- [x] Make the units singular when appropriate
- [ ] Make the 0 units disappear when appropriate

*The likelihood that I actually do the above tasks seems rather low...*
