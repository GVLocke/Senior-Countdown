# Senior-Countdown

Simple website that counts down to my senior graduation. As I don't know anything about web design code, it's a conglomeration of other people's stuff, specifically various Pens from [Matt Smith](https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pens/public).

## Goals
- Add a live progress bar
- Possibly tweak the overall design (idk if I'm a big fan of the neon or not the longer I look at it)
