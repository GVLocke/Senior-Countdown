# Senior-Countdown

Simple website that counts down to my senior graduation. As I don't know anything about web design code, it's a conglomeration of other people's stuff, specifically various Pens from [Matt Smith](https://codepen.io/AllThingsSmitty/pens/public) and [Traf](https://codepen.io/traf).

## Goals
- Possibly tweak the overall design
- Correct layout issues on Mobile
